# deserialise-this

A little json -> POJO challenge.

There are two tasks and one helpful example.

The maven dependencies are supplied, 
and so is a method which reads a file in the `src/main/resources` folder into a String.

## Helpful example
In the `Main` class the `example()` method turns the `moreComplicatedObject.json` file 
into an object of type `MoreComplicatedObject`.

## Task 1
You may not need the helpful example for this one!

Uncomment the line `main.simple()` method in the static main method.

Fill in the `Simple` class so that it works with the `simple.json` file.

## Task 2
This one is more of a stretch.

Uncomment the line `main.challenge()` method in the static main method.

Fill in the `Challenge` class so that it works with the `challenge.json` file.
